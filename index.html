						<h2>About me</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Coding fascinates me. It's a problem to get stuck into and solve, to collaborate on with
						 others or to test your own ingenuity and knowledge to their limits. It's a unique form
						  of self expression. And it's an opportunity to contribute to a larger project with your own two 
						  (digital) hands while working alongside like-minded people. Code is all these things on top of 
						  being one of the most powerful tools we have at our disposal. To me, that's incredible.</p>

						<h2>What I do</h2>
					</header>
					<p>In my spare time, I have been developing a small game in Unity. My goal was to further develop
						my skills with coding whilst working on a project I have passion for. I've always found practical,
						hands-on learning has suited me best.</p>

					<p>That project has given me familiarity with Unity, C#, version control and a plethora of useful coding 
						techniques and practices.</p>

						<h2>Behaviour trees</h2>
						<p>
							My first go at coding enemies for my games were messy tangles of if/else statements. It was pretty evident this method wasn't scalable and I just <strong>knew</strong>	
							that game devs must have a better way of solving this problem. Through this, I found behaviour trees.
						</p>
						<p>After closely following tutorials and guides for several hours and then experimenting for several more, I eventually ended up with the framework of a functioning behaviour tree. This both solved my problem and taught me a significant
							amount about coding techniques and practices.
						</p>
						<p>The implimentation of these trees into my project deepened my understanding of scalable code, recursion, inheritance and encapsulation alongside many other small lessons to take away.
							Not least of all, I now use this knowledge in my projects to produce an overall better product.

								<h2>Lock-on system</h2>
								<p>A staple of the third-person genre, a lock on system was crucial for user experience and comfortable play.</p>
								<p>To implement this system, I wanted the player to be able to:</p>
								<ul style="list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: inside;">
									<li>Lock on to the nearest enemy and face them</li>
									<li>Move the lock to the next closest enemy</li>
									<li>Only lock on to enemies within range</li>
									<li>Change target when the current target is invalid</li>
									<li>Cancel the lock</li>
								</ul>
								<p>I would need the number of stored targets to be dynamic so an array wasn't suitable. I settled on keeping a list of valid targets for the player to lock on to.
									When the player inputs a request to lock-on, the script would collect all the objects tagged as enemies and store them. To get these enemies ordered by distance from
									the player, I would then need to use a lambda function (a technique I learned during the solving of this problem) to calculate the distance of each object
									and then sort in ascending order.
								</p>
								<p>Next, I would need to only lock on to targets within a pre-set radius around the player, so that the player wouldn't ever become locked to an enemy off screen. 
									For this, I would count the number of targets that were in range during the lambda function and then only take the first <i>n</i> results from the stored list
									as the final lock-on list. By clamping the upper limit of <i>n</i>, I could also implement a cap on the number of enemies that player would need to keep track of.
								</p>
								<p>Once the player has a target, a new function, "CheckLock", would be added to the "OnUpdate" delegate. This would check whether the current target was still valid and cause
									the player to lock on to the next target if it was not valid. When the player unlocks, this function is removed from OnUpdate so as to not waste processing power.
								</p>
